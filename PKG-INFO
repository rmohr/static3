Description: This distribution provides an easy way to include static content
        in your WSGI applications. There is a convenience method for serving
        files located via pkg_resources. There are also facilities for serving
        mixed (static and dynamic) content using "magic" file handlers.
        Python builtin string substitution and Kid template support are provided
        and it is easy to roll your own handlers. Note that this distribution
        does not require Kid unless you want to use that type of template. Also
        provides a command of the same name as a convenience when you just want
        to share a little content over HTTP, ad hoc.
